Here’s a reworded README that preserves the same structure and steps but uses fresh phrasing so it doesn’t read like a copy.

# Contextual Chatbot with PyTorch

A lightweight PyTorch project that demonstrates how to build a simple intent-based chatbot.  
- Designed to be beginner-friendly and a quick on-ramp to core chatbot ideas.  
- Uses a compact feed-forward network with two hidden layers to keep things clear and hackable.  
- Tailor behavior by editing intents.json; retrain to apply changes.





## Setup

### Create a virtual env

Use any tool preferred (conda or venv). Example with venv:

```bash
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
python3 -m venv venv
```

### Activate the env

macOS / Linux:

```bash
. venv/bin/activate
```

Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install PyTorch and deps

Install PyTorch from the official site that matches the OS/CUDA setup, then add NLTK:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

If tokenization errors appear on first run, fetch the Punkt model once:

```python
python
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download('punkt')
```

## How to run

Train the model:

```bash
python train.py
```

Training creates data.pth. Start a chat session with:

```bash
python chat.py
```

## Customize intents

All domain logic lives in intents.json. Add or tweak tags, patterns, and responses, then retrain. Example:

```json
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greeting",
      "patterns": [
        "Hi",
        "Hey",
        "How are you",
        "Is anyone there?",
        "Hello",
        "Good day"
      ],
      "responses": [
        "Hey :-)",
        "Hello, thanks for visiting",
        "Hi there, what can I do for you?",
        "Hi there, how can I help?"
      ]
    }
    // more intents...
  ]
}
```

## Layout

```txt
.
├─ data/
│  └─ intents.json
├─ model.py
├─ nltk_utils.py
├─ train.py
├─ chat.py
├─ data.pth          # produced after training
└─ README.md
```

## Tips

- Retrain every time intents.json changes so the model picks up new patterns.  
- On Windows, python may replace python3 in commands depending on the installation.  
- Keep intents small and focused; many narrow patterns usually work better than a few broad ones.
